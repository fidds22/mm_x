- **Comments in code must be in English**
- **Documentation must be in English**
- **Maintain artistic integrity** in all design decisions
- **Respect the exhibition theme** of color and form as languages in movement

### 💻 Development Standards

- **Use conventional commit format:** `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, etc.
- **Write descriptive commit messages** that explain what and why
- **Test functionality before committing**
- **NEVER push to main without permission or consent**
- **Always ask before committing** after finishing work
